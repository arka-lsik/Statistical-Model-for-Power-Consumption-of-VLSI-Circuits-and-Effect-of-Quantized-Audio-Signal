This study explores how the noise came and how there is average distortion is generate at detection end of a practical end-to-end communication systems. The next part of this study explores where noise is not only introduced at the signal receiving end but also can accumulate at intermediate stages, particularly at quantization, source encoding \& channel encoding etc. Now it reflects the effect of data compression required by transmission over bandwidth-limited channels. In this context, I modeled the big data using a Gaussian mixture model (GMM), which undergoes uniform and entropy-coded quantization before clustering through the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. The analysis explores how clustering accuracy is affected by the number of quantization levels. This effective unsupervised machine learning algorithm, based on distribution-based clustering, can also address challenges in the VLSI design flow domain (including CPU/GPU design), particularly in estimating and optimizing power consumption of VLSI circuits. The approach is modeled through statistical predictive analysis and evaluated using several performance metrics for comprehensive comparison. Overall, this study provides a framework that connects the solution of signal processing problems to VLSI circuit domain challenges through the use of mathematical modeling.
